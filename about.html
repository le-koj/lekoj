        Le Koj’s passion for programming stems from the nature of coding,
        in which, practically, every algorithm is a puzzle to be solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thrill of being presented with new problems at every turn,
        and having to generate solution after solution to resolve the problem,
        are what empowers him daily to practice programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Le Koj’s 1st experience with programming began with MySQL,
        followed by python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Till date,
        Le Koj has knowledge of numerous languages and standards including php,
        jQuery, OOP etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he continues to advance his knowledge,  the immediate focus is
        the design and, development of interactive and secure front-end
        applications.

        Le Koj completed his 1st film at the end of the summer of 2011.
        The subjects of the production involved his college colleagues,
        and the theme revolved around their most excitable and memorable
        exploits of the summer.  a single Flip UtraHD video camera,
        his 1st video camera, filmed each moment. Though, not very satisfactory,
        it was a great lesson in video making and filming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Le Koj has continued to chisel and strengthen his filming
        and video making knowledge through the practice of photography,
        exploring literatures on film theory and video production,
        and implementing practices acquired from various sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2014, Le Koj produced for 2 Virginia based media startups,
        and has continued to film diverse events, venues and occasions.
